## Concept:

A full description of what your project is all about 

My project is a a trivia maze game, you will race the computer hopefully beating it to the finish. The more questions you get right the more you travel your turn.

## Technologies Used:

* HTML
* CSS
* JavaScript 
* External JavaScript Library

## Approach:

#### Overview
Description of how you approach the game development. Here you will add all the development phases, from wireframes to code sample. 

At first I approached the code with the idea of writing a large loop to run the game and have a timer set before the next question is asked. I couldn't figure out how to manage this so eventually I fell back on hard coding the logic of the game and making the player move if right and if not the computer has a chance, and visa versa.

#### User stories

As an user I expect to see a welcome button to enter the game, then a prompt for my name and a computer button. Upon clicking this the game will start. Once this happens I can open the instructions whenever and the game will continue to open a modal asking a question and prompting an answer. 

#### Development Plan 

description of your development plan 

* Development Plan  ONE: Originally I wanted the user to move through the maze with the arrow keys and to have a question every 3 seconds. This became too challenging.
* Development Plan  Two: Then I decided to make 3 versions (over time) the first a hard code version, the second an arrow key movement addition, and finally a full game with a 2 player option and a timer for the questions.
* Development Plan  Three: I decided to fall back on hard coding just to be safe and fully complete my logic, although this is harder and not DRY the time-limit forced me to make this decision.


#### MVP

* MVP ONE:
* MVP Two
* MVP Three 
* MVP Four

#### Stretch goals

* Stretch goals ONE: To add arrow movements.
* Stretch goals Two: To add a timer for the questions.
* Stretch goals Three: To add a 2 player option.
* Stretch goals Four: To pretty up the CSS. 

## Challenges:

Small description of a challange you faced. 

I already described my largest challenges. The arrow key addition, and the timer for the questions outside of the for loop. The unsyncronized code will only run after the syncronized code and rethinking/learning that would've taken too long.
